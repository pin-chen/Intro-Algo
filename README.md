## HW1 Sort (Text Input)

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. counting sort.
2. string processing.

**Final Rank: 3rd.**

## HW2 Sparse Matrix

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. less range for mult.
2. string processing.

**Final Rank: 3rd.**

## HW3 N queens problem

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. let it be n-m row and n-m column.
2. every row and column only check 1 time in the same state (linked list).

**Final Rank: 3rd.**

## HW4 Increasing Pairs

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. merge sort, insertion sort.
2. do not complete the sort.
3. use larger space to get less flt.

**Final Rank: 2nd.**

## HW5 Simple Chain

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. xor linked list
2. chainning hash
3. record 2 possible answers

**Final Rank: 2nd.**

## HW6 BST

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. splay tree

**Final Rank: 7th.**

## HW7 Smart Text Input

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. loop by word.
2. DP the number of character by < set >

**Final Rank: 9th.**

## HW8 Minimal Cover

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. Greedy (sort by the starting point, the largest end of eyery case)
2. input string processing.

**Final Rank: 2nd.**

## HW9 Vertex Coloring

My way which let it be more optimally: 

1. DFS

**Final Rank: 5th.**
